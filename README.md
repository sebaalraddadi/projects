## About The Project 
This project is an internal web system designed to streamline the documentation and tracking of daily tasks within the IT department. Currently, many departments rely on verbal or paper-based communication, leading to lost tasks and difficulty in tracking performance.

**The goal of this system is to:**
* Replace traditional manual methods with a unified digital system.
* Allow employees to document tasks and upload attachments easily.
* Enable the department head to track progress and evaluate performance efficiently.

* **User & Manager Interfaces:** Dedicated dashboards for employees and admins.

* **File Attachments:** Ability to upload files/reports related to tasks.
* **Performance Tracking:** Tools for the manager to monitor completion rates and delays.
